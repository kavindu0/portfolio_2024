    <div id="Introduction:" class="section">
      <h2>Introduction to JASP</h2>
      <p>JASP, an acronym for Jeffreysâ€™s Amazing Statistics Program, is a free and open-source statistical software
        designed to make statistical analysis accessible and user-friendly. Developed with a focus on both simplicity
        and advanced statistical modeling, JASP provides a comprehensive platform for researchers, students, and
        professionals to analyze and interpret data with ease. In this guide, we will explore the functionalities of
        JASP and walk through examples to demonstrate its application.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="1. Getting Started with JASP" class="section">
      <h2>Getting Started with JASP</h2>
      <h3>1. Installation and Setup</h3>
      <p>Begin by downloading and installing JASP from the official <a
        href="https://jasp-stats.org/">JASP website</a>. Once installed, launch the
        application to start your statistical journey.</p>

      <h3>2. User Interface Overview</h3>
      <p>JASP boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The main screen is divided into several sections,
        including a spreadsheet area for data input, a module toolbar for selecting analyses, and output panels for
        results.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="2. Conducting Analyses in.." class="section">
      <h2>Conducting Analyses in JASP</h2>
      <h3>1. Descriptive Statistics</h3>
      <p>JASP offers a variety of descriptive statistics to summarize and explore your data. To generate descriptive
        statistics, click on the "Descriptives" module under the "Frequencies" dropdown.</p>
      <!--      -->

      <h3>2. T-Tests and ANOVA</h3>
      <p>JASP simplifies the process of conducting t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Navigate to the "T-Tests"
        or "ANOVA" module to perform these analyses.</p>
      <!--      -->

      <h3>3. Correlation and Regression</h3>
      <p>For exploring relationships between variables, use the "Correlation" and "Regression" modules. JASP provides
        visual aids, such as scatterplots, to enhance interpretation.
      </p>
      <!--      -->

      <h3>4. Bayesian Analyses</h3>
      <p>JASP distinguishes itself by incorporating Bayesian statistical methods. The "Bayesian t-test" and "Bayesian
        ANOVA" modules allow users to make inferences based on Bayesian principles.</p>
      <!--      -->

      <h3>5. Data Visualization</h3>
      <p>JASP's visualization capabilities include histograms, box plots, and scatterplots. Simply select the "Graphs"
        dropdown to access these options.
      </p>
      <!--      -->

    <div id="3. Advantages of Using JASP" class="section">
      <h2>Advantages of Using JASP</h2>
      <h3>1. User-Friendly Interface</h3>
      <p>JASP is designed with a focus on usability, making statistical analyses accessible to individuals with varying
        levels of statistical expertise.</p>

      <h3>2. Bayesian and Frequentist Statistics</h3>
      <p>JASP seamlessly integrates both Bayesian and frequentist approaches, allowing users to choose the statistical
        paradigm that best suits their needs.</p>

      <h3>3. Python Scripting</h3>
      <p>QGIS supports Python scripting for automation and advanced analysis. The <strong>Python Console</strong> allows
        you to run scripts within QGIS.</p>
