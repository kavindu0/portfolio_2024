      <h2>Introduction to QGIS Analysis</h2>
      <p>QGIS, or Quantum Geographic Information System, is an open-source platform that empowers users to analyze and
        visualize spatial data. Whether you're a GIS professional or a novice, QGIS offers a myriad of tools for spatial
        analysis that can unravel the hidden patterns and insights within geographical data. In this comprehensive
        guide, we will explore various aspects of QGIS analysis, from the basic functionalities to advanced techniques,
        all enriched with practical examples.</p>

    <div id="1. Understanding QGIS Basics" class="section">
      <h2>Understanding QGIS Basics</h2>
      <h3>1. Installation and Setup</h3>
      <p>Before diving into analysis, it's essential to set up QGIS. Visit the official <a
        href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html">QGIS website</a> to download and install the latest
        version. Once installed, open QGIS and familiarize yourself with the interface.</p>

      <h3>2. Data Import</h3>
      <p>QGIS supports various data formats such as shapefiles, GeoTIFFs, and more. To perform analysis, import your
        spatial datasets into QGIS. Go to <strong>Layer > Add Layer > Add Vector Layer</strong> for vector data or
        <strong>Layer > Add Layer > Add Raster Layer</strong> for raster data.</p>

    <div id="2. Essential QGIS Analysis.." class="section">
      <h2>Essential QGIS Analysis Tools</h2>
      <h3>1. Spatial Query</h3>
      <p>Spatial queries help filter data based on their spatial relationships. For example, you can select all points
        within a specific polygon. To do this, use the <strong>Select by Location</strong> tool under the
        <strong>Vector</strong> menu.</p>

      <h3>2. Buffer Analysis</h3>
      <p>Buffer analysis involves creating a zone around a feature. This is useful for understanding the proximity of
        features. Go to <strong>Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Buffer</strong> to create a buffer zone around your
        selected features.</p>

    <div id="Conclusion:" class="section">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>CSS variables, denoted by the <span class="circle-sketch-highlight">--var </span>syntax, bring a new dimension
        to styling in web development. Their ability
        to dynamically adapt styles, simplify maintenance, enable conditional styling, and streamline theming makes them
        a powerful tool for developers. As the web development landscape continues to evolve, CSS variables stand as a
        testament to the ongoing effort to enhance the flexibility and expressiveness of Cascading Style Sheets.
        Incorporating these variables into your projects can significantly improve the maintainability and adaptability
        of your styles, contributing to a more efficient and robust development workflow.</p>
