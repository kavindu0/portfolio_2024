      <h2>Introduction to JASP</h2>
      <p>JASP, an acronym for Jeffreysâ€™s Amazing Statistics Program, is a free and open-source statistical software
        designed to make statistical analysis accessible and user-friendly. Developed with a focus on both simplicity
        and advanced statistical modeling, JASP provides a comprehensive platform for researchers, students, and
        professionals to analyze and interpret data with ease. In this guide, we will explore the functionalities of
        JASP and walk through examples to demonstrate its application.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="1. Getting Started with JASP" class="section">
      <h2>Getting Started with JASP</h2>
      <h3>1. Installation and Setup</h3>
      <p>Begin by downloading and installing JASP from the official <a
        href="https://jasp-stats.org/">JASP website</a>. Once installed, launch the
        application to start your statistical journey.</p>

      <h3>2. User Interface Overview</h3>
      <p>JASP boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The main screen is divided into several sections,
        including a spreadsheet area for data input, a module toolbar for selecting analyses, and output panels for
        results.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="2. Conducting Analyses in.." class="section">
      <h2>Conducting Analyses in JASP</h2>
      <h3>1. Descriptive Statistics</h3>
      <p>JASP offers a variety of descriptive statistics to summarize and explore your data. To generate descriptive
        statistics, click on the "Descriptives" module under the "Frequencies" dropdown.</p>
